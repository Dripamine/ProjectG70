In Array 1, the least expensive UAV is the MAV with a model of "ModelY", size of 0.4, weight of 1.5, and price of 180.0. The most expensive UAV is the AgriculturalDrone with a brand of "FarmersChoice", carry capacity of 12, weight of 60.0, and price of 5500.0.

In Array 2, there are no UAV objects present. Therefore, the output correctly states that no UAVs were found in this array.

The output confirms that the findLeastAndMostExpensiveUAV() method successfully identifies the least and most expensive UAVs in the given arrays, as expected.
