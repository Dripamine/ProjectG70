The "Original Objects" section displays the information of the original objects created in the main method.

The "Copied Objects" section displays the information of the copied objects returned by the copyFlyingObjects method.
Each copied object has the same attribute values as its corresponding original object, indicating that the copying process is successful.

The copied objects are of the same type as the original objects, preserving the class hierarchy and inheritance.

The displayed information confirms that the copyFlyingObjects method successfully creates a copy of the original array, ensuring that any modifications made to the copied objects will not affect the original objects.

The output matches the expected behavior based on the requirements of Part II of the project.
